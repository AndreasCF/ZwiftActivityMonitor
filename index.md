**Release 1.2.6 now available**

* Added support customizable split goals
  * ZAM continues to layout initial splits using split distance, goal distance, and goal time.
  * Splits can then be edited, removed, or even added manually.
  * Total distance and time will update according to custom entries.
* System settings now allows for window coordinates ranging from -9999 to 99999.  Hopefully this rectifies auto-window positioning issues.

The readme file will contain additional information related to Splits and their configuration.
