**Release 1.2.4 now available**
This mini-release contains a couple of enhancements requested by ZAM users.

* Split goal display changes: When the split screen comes automatically into view it will have a color coded background (for two seconds). Green if you're ahead of your goal, Red if you're behind.  This was suggested as the auto-display was often missed during hard TTT efforts.  Another addition is a real-time running delta time field, so you can actively monitor your progress without waiting for the split to complete. 

* Timer setup window changes: Along with time configuration comes a new option to start data collection as soon as the timer expires, rather than waiting for the event clock to begin. This was suggested as it seems WTRL TTTs start timing as soon as the first rider crosses the start banner, not when crossing the official starting line later in the course (often 15-30s later). The default is still to wait for the event timer which is suitable for most other situations.
