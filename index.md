**Release 1.2.4.2 now available**
Fixes some issues in the splits window when goals have been set.

* It was pointed out that if you're riding AHEAD of your goal time, the delta value should be negative, not positive.
* Fixed an issue with the delta value bouncing around too much.  Seems much more stable now.
* Added color coding to the delta value.  Just like the splits you see on TV!
